# UC Berkeley Economics 143: Spring 2023

This repo comprises of a compilation of 5 problem sets/projects for UC Berkeley's ECON 143, Applied Econometrics. Econ 143 is the second course in econometrics taken after either Econ 140 (Econometrics)or Econ 141 (Math Intensive Metrics). After taking Econ 141 with Demian Pouzo in Fall 2022, I took Econ 143 with Bryan Graham in Spring 2023. 

This class was super difficult and rewarding and might be my favorite course at Berkeley. I made many (hopefully life-long) friends during this class and I hope at least one of us gets their PhD in Econ.

Project Titles:
