# econ 143

This repo comprises of a compilation of 5 problem sets/projects for UC Berkeley's ECON 143, Applied Econometrics. I took the course in Spring 2023 with Bryan Graham. 

This is an elective course, typically taken after ECON 140 (Econometrics) or ECON 141 (Mathematically-Intensive Econometrics), the required econometrics class.

Project Titles:

  1) Duration and Survival Analysis for Prison Recidivism

  2) Supply and Demand Estimation and Intrumental Variables for Gasoline Prices

  3) Model Selection and Regression Trees for Education and Earnings

  4) Quantile Regression for Education and Earnings

  5) Production Function Estimation for Chipmakers
