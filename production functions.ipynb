    "STATISTICAL:\n",
    "The distribution seems to have a long tail, with a few firms having far higher TFPR in the year 2014. This displays that we have large outliers to the right of the median, with not many outliers to the left of the median. Thus, we can say that the average of this distribution would be skewed upward, and the mean would be larger than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "FUNDAMENTAL:\n",
    "Keeping in mind that we assumed CRS, (alpha and beta need to add up to one), Looking at the new chart made above, we can see that the firms with the highest productivity have higher returns from capital. This makes sense, as the difference in residual could be attributed to the qualitative strenths of increased capital spending (the spending for capital goes into producing diversified products, as opposed to producing more products)\n",
    "\n",
    "Caution: there are a few estimates of beta very close to 1 and one that is far higher than 1. We can see the firms for which this is true below. This is not an issue because the way we calculated this beta is by taking the wage bill over the sales number. These just indicate years where employees were paid more than the sales number. Ideally, this single observation would've been removed when we took out the negative VA's. \n",

    "Construct estimates of $A_{t}$ for $t=2014$ based on the production function estimated in questions $7$ and $8$ above. Calculate the 10th and 90th percentiles of your estimated TFP distribution. Additionally construct an estimate of firms' returns-to-scale. Use the bootstrap to construct 95 percent confidence intervals for the 10th and 90th percentiles of the distribution of semiconductor firms' TFP in 2014. Similarly construct a confidence interval for returns-to-scale: $\\eta=\\alpha+\\beta$."
